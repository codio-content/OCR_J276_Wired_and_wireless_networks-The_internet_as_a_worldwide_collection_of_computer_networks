Every computer accessing the internet â€“ both host and client - needs a unique address in order to communicate with other computers. 
This is provided by its IP address - IP stands for Internet Protocol; the set of procedures used by computers to access and communicate over the internet.

Some computers, especially web servers must have a static IP address that never changes as they need to be contacted by millions of clients but the clients can have dynamic IP addresses that can change. Our IP addresses are allotted to us by our internet service providers when we log in.


An IP address originally consisted of 4, 8-bit numbers e.g.  95.176.159.226 as represented in denary. This is IPv4 and as it provides only about 4 billion unique addresses a new system called IPv6 is being introduced.  IPv6 uses 128 bits to create a single unique address on the network.  128 bits provide $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ unique addresses. No, you work it out!!!
