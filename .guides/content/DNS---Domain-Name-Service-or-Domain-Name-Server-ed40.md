When a browser requests access to a host using its domain name, the client computer contacts a DNS server. The DNS server contains a database of domain names which allows it to look up the domain name and return the IP address. This is known as **resolving** the domain name.
If that server hasnâ€™t got that domain name in its database, it will contact another one and so on until it is returned.
