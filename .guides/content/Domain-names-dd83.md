A domain name is a string used to represent the four 8-bit numbers of the IP address. Text is far easier for us humans to remember and use that all those bits.
We type in the domain name when we enter the URL â€“ Uniform Resource Locator or web address.
For example, it is far easier to remember ocr.org than the numbers 69.195.124.159.
