A host is a computer that provides services, resources and applications that can be accessed by users working at other computers in remote locations across a network. The remote computers are referred to as **clients**.

**Web hosting** companies rent space on their web servers where people can develop their own websites that can be accessed by users all over the world using the World Wide Web. In 1969 there were four host computer systems and today there are tens of millions.

A backbone of cables spanning the globe provides the communications infrastructure. They are installed and maintained by large companies such as IBM and AT&T who charge other firms, including the hosting companies, internet service providers and eventually us for access.
