In this lesson we will look at how the internet is organised as a WAN, how users connect to remote servers and how the internet is used for data storage.

The internet is a huge WAN – a global system of interconnected computer networks serving billions of users worldwide. It is often called a ‘network of networks’ because it consists of millions of linked private, public, academic, business and government networks.

It provides many services including email, file transfer and the World Wide Web which was first proposed by the British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He created the first website in 1990.
