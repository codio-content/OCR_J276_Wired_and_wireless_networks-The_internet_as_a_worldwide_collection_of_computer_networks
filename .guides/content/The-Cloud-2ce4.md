Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of a computer's hard drive. The cloud just means the Internet.

The most common use of the cloud is for data storage but all of the software accessed by a computer user can be stored there e.g. Office online and Google tools.

Cloud computing provides advantages for individuals and businesses, such as:

- Lower maintenance costs: software does not need to be installed, maintained or upgraded on the local computers or servers.
- Software does not have to be ‘bought’ and businesses only have to pay for those parts that they need to use (this is known as ‘software as a service’).
- All software is automatically upgraded.
- As long as they have Internet access, employees can work from anywhere in the world.
- All data is automatically backed up at the remote site.
- Employees can collaborate on the same documents because they are not stored on one particular computer.

There are disadvantages:

- An Internet connection is needed.
- Download and upload speeds can be affected by the internet connection.
- The hosting company could be targeted by online hackers.
- The creators and owners of the data have less control if the data are held by another company.
- Storing some data online may breach the Data Protection Act as it should be kept secure and confidential.
