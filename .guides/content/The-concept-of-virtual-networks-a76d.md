A virtual network is created through software rather than hardware. A large LAN can be subdivided into a series of virtual LANs (VLANs) so that teams can have their own virtual LAN and communicate and share information just with each other. 
These VLANs share the same hardware infrastructure but through software they are separate logical LANs.

It also increases security as the sensitive data of each team can be kept separate from the others. Encryption software is used to ensure that all communication is secure.
As it only appears to be, and is not really, a private, unique network it is said to be virtual. 

Virtual networking can also include the technology that allows the control of one or more remotely located computers over the Internet. 
Data can be stored and retrieved, software can be run and peripherals can be operated through a Web browser as if the distant computers were onsite.
